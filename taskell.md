## On Hold


## Scrapped

- GameObject should be class and have variable "hasStarted" (for events to know if they should execute)
- Make Start command
- Make engine execute command (class)
- Remove step() function from engine?
- Equals should see if gameObjects are in the same scene
- Write down the meaning of all of this
- Make Circle intersect with Line
- Stopping game engine should free the game object, and the scene shouldn't be active anymore
- GameManager builder
- Render food AND snake with #
